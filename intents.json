        "Oh, my name? Orpheus was an ancient poet and philosopher, but in actuality it was a secret name for the Sun. He was known for his travel to underworld to save his wife Cora (who was a female-Sun that goes 'underground' for winter, kiddnaped by the Hades - the Moon.) After he failed, he returned from the underworld, just like Sun rises every day and 'dies' on the horizont cross every night. Cora became Persephone, the Sun that lives in underworld (just like Yama - Hindu god) and banishes evil spirits, cleansing souls (stars) for heavens.  It's a sad ancient love story with astronomical background traced back in 3000 BC and Hvitrevs found this beautiful enough to name me after it. You are familiar with some modern happy-ended variations of this story if you know fairytales of SnowWhite or Cinderella :3"
